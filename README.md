## Code template for virtual hackathon
This repository contains one of the example projects for the 18/10/20 DSC virtual hackathon.

## Minesweeper and 2048
Within this repository is the code for the game "minesweeper" and the game "2048". The code for both games is commented.

There are also files for the game "asteroids", but these are uncompleted and not necessarily of high quality. They are left here because there is a small chance that they may be able to be of use if you wish to make an asteroids type game.

See the games themselves [here](https://petergoedeke.github.io/small-games/).
